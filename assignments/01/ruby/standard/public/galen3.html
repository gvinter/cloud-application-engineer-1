<p>I've done a few sites. My first full site was <a href="http://www.maplesandbloom.com">Maples &amp; Bloom's site</a>. Maples &amp; Bloom is a start-up landscaping company with an organic focus, based out of Nashville Tennessee.</p>

<p>The next site I built was one for myself that I called <a href="http://www.galenlive.com/beyondxy">Beyond XY</a>. The premise for the site was to build a portfolio and eventually a client base that needed data visualizations.</p>

<p>My first mobile work was for <a href="http://doctype.svtesting.com">Doctype.com</a> when I created an iPhone-friendly viewing site. With only an extra style sheet, I was able to implement a new design that was custom for the iPhone.</p>

<p>Now, I'm excited to move towards freelance Rails development! I have a landing page that's a work in progress, <a href="http://www.galenvinter.com">GalenVinter.com</a> but I'm getting some design help and can't wait to be my own business!</p>
